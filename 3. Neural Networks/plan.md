## Motivation

-

## What are NNs?

- neural networks are general function approximators

- multiple layers prevent them being equivalent

- the key thing to remember is "neural networks build more complex representations from simpler ones"

## Building a neural network in Pytorch

- torch.nn.sequential

## Training

## Where are we on the map of our journey to ChatGPT?
