## Aims

- understand that a neural network is a
- understand that neural networks build hierarchical representations
- understand that neural networks learn their own representations
- understand that nns can approximate any continuous function
- build a neural network in pytorch
- introduce torch.nn.module
- train a neural network in pytorch
- explain that there are many other layers

## Motivation

-

## What are NNs?

- neural networks are general function approximators

- multiple layers prevent them being equivalent

- the key thing to remember is "neural networks build more complex representations from simpler ones"

## Building a neural network in Pytorch

- torch.nn.sequential

## Training

## Where are we on the map of our journey to ChatGPT?
