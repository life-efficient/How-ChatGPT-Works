# purpose of the program

- to take you from understanding neural networks, to understanding how chatGPT works
- it will be hard
- it will be mathematical
- there will be lots of programming
- a lot of you will give up
- but it is my job to make sure as many of you as possible make it to the end
- and to help you every step of the way
- but by the end of the day, you will be in a very elite group of people who can both understand and program the state of the art in artificial intelligence
- and that will make you very valuable
