# purpose of the program

# Programme outline

- over the next few weeks
- I will help you go from a basic understanding of machine learning and programming
- to implementing your own version of chatGPT
- learning not just the theory, but also the code and engineering behind the system

- it will be hard
- it will be mathematical
- there will be lots of programming
- a lot of you will give up
- but it is my job to make sure as many of you as possible make it to the end
- and to help you every step of the way
- but by the end of the day, you will be in a very elite group of people who can both understand and program the state of the art in artificial intelligence
- and that will make you very valuable

## Why?

- All of this is totally free, and I'm going to share everything after the series is up
- I am teaching you this because

1. It's so interesting
2. It will make you very valuable

The least you can do later tonight is buy me pizza

## Intro to me

- You're probably all thinking "who's this young guy and when is he going to introduce the lecturer"
- well in fact, I am your lecturer
- some people call me professor Berg
- and other people call me more ridiculous nicknames

- I've
- And i'm confident that you will quickly see this for yourself

## ChatGPT overview

- you've all seen chatgpt so I'm not going to go over what it's capable of
- the key thing is that it can

1. generate extremely human-like text that's coherent over entire conversations
2. Engage in back and forth conversation
3. It also won't respond inappropriately, which makes it safe to use

- this is a map of that journey

## format of sessions

- we will not be talking for hours on end
- hopefully most of the time should be spent programming
- we will intertwine explanations, demonstrations and time for you to code

- house rules
  - the first rule of
    - only joking
    - the first rule is...
    - if you get stuck, you try to help yourself, then you ask for help

## Quiz to get an idea of who's in the room

## Today's plan

- get everyone on the same page
- get over the jargon
- write our first machine learning code to take the first steps

## how to access the material

- access this github repo
- hit the button to open in colab

- how to run the code
  - i need to take a stand against helping people to run anything other than colab notebooks
  - we simply do not have time to
    - set up python
    - debug your environment
