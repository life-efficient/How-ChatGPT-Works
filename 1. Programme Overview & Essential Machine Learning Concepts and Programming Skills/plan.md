- before we get into the depths, there are some things that I just simply need you to understand, and make sure we're all on the same page about

## What is machine learning?

- any computer system that can improve on a task (T) as measured by a performance metric (P) with experience (E)

## The 4 typical components of any machine learning algorithm

### Data

Glossary
- Example
- Tensor


### Model



- ML models are functions
- there are endless different functions you can create
- some functions have parameters
- by changing those paramters you can change the function they represent
- one way you can change the parameters is by doing gradient descent
- make it clear about vector representations and space
- give guidance of how to think about high dimensional vectors

- explain the concept of loss functions
- explain the concept of regularization
- introduce the concept of overfitting
- explain the concept of hyperparameters
- explain the concept of cross-validation
- explain the concept of feature engineering
- explain the concept of data pre-processing
- explain the concept of model evaluation

## Introducing the map of how we will build up to ChatGPT

- We need to be able to understand complex data like text
- We need to generate text data
- We need to be able to make sure the system is safe to use

## Where are we on the map of our journey to ChatGPT?
